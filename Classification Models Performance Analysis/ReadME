1. German credit data is imported into the RStudio
2. The data is cleaned, scaled and encoded in R.
3. Processed & cleaned data is exported as csv in R.
4. Processed csv data is imported in Python (Kaggle notebook).
5. All Machine Learning Classification models are built for classification on the data.
6. Metrics, confusion matrices are stored as csv files for each model.
7. Model performance and speed is checked for different learning rates and number of estimators, then stored in the corresponding csv files.
8. The best model is selected and tuning methods is applied on it. The results for different tuning methods are stored in the csv file.
9. `metrics.csv`, `conf_matrices.csv`, `perf_by_lr.csv`, `perf_by_nestimators.csv`, `tuning_methods.csv` are created and exported in Python.
10. Resulted csv files are imported in RStudio.
11. Shiny Interactive Dashboard is built using the resulted csv files.
